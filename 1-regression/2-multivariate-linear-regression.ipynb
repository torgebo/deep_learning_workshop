    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Public bike-sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the process from membership, rental, and return back of bicycles have become automatic. Through these systems, a user is able to easily rent a bicycle from a particular position and return it back to another position. Currently, there are about 500 bike-sharing systems around the world which are composed of over 500 thousand bicycles. Today, there exist great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental, and health issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from interesting real-world applications of these kinds of bike-sharing systems, the data being generated by these systems make them desirable for research as well. As opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival position is explicitly recorded. This feature turns bike-sharing into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in a city. Hence, it is expected that significant events in a city could be detected by monitoring these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions,\n",
    "precipitation, day of the week, season, hour of the day, and more can affect rental behaviours. The core dataset is related to a two-year historical log between 2011 and 2012 from the Capital Bikeshare system (Washington D.C., USA) which is publicly available at http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. The data was aggregated hourly as well as daily and then combined with weather and seasonal information. Weather information was extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com.\n",

    "As opposed to standard model parameters, such as the weights in a linear model, hyperparamters are user-specified parameters not learned by the training process, i.e. they are specified *a priori*. In the following section we will look at how we can define and evaluate a few different hyperparameters relevant to our previously defined model. The hyperparameters we will take a look at are:\n",

    "* Batch size\n",
    "\n",
    "## Digression: Different Sets of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ultimate goals of machine learning is for our models to *generalise well*. That is, we would like the performance of our model on the data we have trained on, i.e. the **in-sample** error, to be representative of the performance of our model on the data we are attempting to model, i.e. the **out-of-sample** error. Unfortunately, for most problems we are unable to test our model on all possible data that we have not trained on. This might be due to difficulties gathering new data or simply because the amount of possible data is very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, we have to settle for a different solution when we want to evaluate our trained models. The go-to solution is to gather a second set of data, in addtion to the training set, called a test set. For the test set to be useful it is important that it is representative of the data we have not trained on. In order words, the error we get on the test set should be close to the out-of-sample error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting appropriate hyperparameters can be seen as a sort of meta-optimisation task on top of the learning task. Now, we could train a model several times, alter some hyperparameters each time, and record the final performance on the test set, however, this will likely yield errors that are overly optimistic. This is because looking at the test set when making learning choices, i.e. selecting hyperparamters, introduces bias and causes the **estimated out-of-sample** error to diverge from the **true out-of-sample** error. Remember, this is the reason why we have a test set in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this problem is to create a third set: the *validation set*. This is typically a partition of the training set, however there exist several *cross validation* methodologies for how to create and use validation sets efficiently. By having this third set we can: (i) use the *training set* to train the trainable model parameters, (ii) use the *validation set* to select hyperparameters, and (iii) use the *test set* to estimate the out-of-sample error. This split ensures that the test set remains unbiased."

    "## Adding $L^2$ Regularization to Our Model\n",
    "\n",
    "$L^2$ regularization, otherwise known as weight decay, ridge regression, or Tikhonov regularization, is a popular form of regularization that penalises the norm of the model parameters. This is done by letting $R(h) = \\frac{1}{2}\\lVert\\mathbf{w}\\rVert_{2}^{2}$, which drives the weights towards the origin. Any point can be selected, but the origin is a good choice if we do not know the correct value. By multiplying with a factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ we will simplify the gradient of $R(h)$.\n",
