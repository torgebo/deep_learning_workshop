    "## The Basics of Multinomial Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Multinomial logistic, or softmax, regression is a generalisation of the classification algorithm logistic regression to multiclass classification problems; these are problems where the target $y$ can be one of $K$ classes, i.e. $y \\in \\{1, \\ldots, K\\}$. Whereas in logistic regression where $\\Pr(y=1\\vert\\mathbf{x})$ is captured by the logistic function $\\sigma(z)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$, where $z=\\mathbf{w}^\\intercal\\mathbf{x}$, the multinomial variant uses the softmax function to capture a multiclass categorical probability distribution. The softmax function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\Pr(y = k\\vert\\mathbf{x}) = \\sigma(\\mathbf{z})_k = \\frac{e^{z_k}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{K}e^{z_i}},\n",

    "$$\n",

    "That is, the softmax function $\\sigma(\\mathbf{z})$ outputs a $K$-dimensional vector of real values between 0 and 1. Each value in this distribution signifies the probability that class $K=i$ is true given the input $\\mathbf{x}$. The numerator exponentiates a predicted log probability $z_k$, while the denominator normalises over all predicted log probabilities $\\mathbf{z}$ to get a valid probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with logistic regression, training the softmax function to output meaningful probabilities can be done using maximum likelihood: $\\underset{\\mathbf{w}}{\\arg\\max}\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})$. Maximising the likelihood is the same as minimising the negative likelihood. Additionally, we typically take the log of the likelihood as it does not change the result but simplifies some of the maths. Doing this yields the following error function when taken over all $N$ training examples: \n",

    "## The Forward Pass: Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now focus on feedforward neural networks which for all intents and purposes is synonymous with multilayer perceptron. An example of a feedforward network can be seen below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/feedforward-nn.png\" alt=\"A simple feedforward network\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "This network consist of two hidden layers $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$, where the input $\\mathbf{x}$ is connected to $\\mathbf{u}$, and $\\mathbf{v}$ is connected to the output $\\mathbf{y}$. These types of hidden layers are typically referred to as *fully-connected* because every neuron in a layer is connected to every neuron in the preceding layer. Fully-connected layers are sometimes called *densely-connected*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of a single neuron typically comprise of two steps: (i) integrate the input by taking a linear combination of the input and associated weights, and (ii) feeding this scalar into an activation function. This can be summarised as a dot product between inputs and weights wrapped in a function, such as the logistic function. To simplify all of these dot products, we can gather all weights linking neurons from one layer to another into a matrix called $\\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$ for layer $l$, where element $\\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{ij}$ indicates the weight from neuron $i$ to neuron $j$ for layer $l$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this representation, the output activation $\\mathbf{a}^{(l)}$ for layer $l$ is simply the matrix-vector product $\\sigma(\\mathbf{a}^{(l-1)}\\mathbf{W}^{(l)})$, where $\\sigma(.)$ is an activation function and is applied *element-wise*. That is, before we apply the activation function we take the activations from the preceding layer $(l-1)$ and multiply it with the weight matrix for the current layer. For example, for the network topology above we can calculate the activations for layer $\\mathbf{u}$ by computing $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}\\mathbf{W}^{(1)})$, assuming $\\mathbf{x}$ is a row vector. This makes sense, because $\\mathbf{x}$ is a $1 \\times 4$ row vector and $\\mathbf{W}^{(1)}$ is $4 \\times 3$ matrix. Thus, the output activation for layer $\\mathbf{u}$ has the size $1 \\times 3$, i.e. there are three neurons with one value each."

As with other learning algorithms, the goal of backpropagation is to minimise an error or loss function.\n",

Backpropagation does this by applying the all too familiar **gradient descent** algorithm we have seen earlier with the **chain rule** of calculus. Using notation from the first notebook, we would like to apply the following update rule to *every* weight in the network: $\\mathbf{W}^{(l)}(k+1)\\leftarrow\\mathbf{W}^{(l)}(k) - \\eta\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial\\mathbf{W}^{(l)}}$, where $k$ is the current iteration or epoch, $\\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$ is the weight matrix for layer $l$.
